description: "Starting up and loading all the pitz data at the beginning of every\n\
  script is really slow.\n\nIt would be nice to make the webapp and the scripts work\
  \ together.  In\nother words, the scripts could send requests to the web app and\
  \ the web\napp could reply.\n\nThe webapp might be able to respond faster than a\
  \ command-line script\nbecause it would already have all the data loaded.\n\nThen\
  \ the scripts would essentially be like a little CLI browser.\n\nThe Accept header\n\
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWe'll do something like this::\n\n    if 'application/x-pitz\
  \ in Accept:\n        return data formatted with bash colorization\n\n    elif if\
  \ 'text/html' in Accept:\n        return HTML format of data\n\n    else:\n    \
  \    return text/plain\n\nExample URLs\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n=======================================\
  \ ===============================\nURL                                     translation\n\
  ======================================= ===============================\n/     \
  \                                  p()\n/?type=task                            \
  \ p(type='task')\n/?type=milestone&reached=0              p(type='milestone', reached=0)\n\
  /?owner=matt&owner=lindsey              p(owner=['matt', 'lindsey'])\n/?type=activity\
  \                         p(type='activity')\n=======================================\
  \ ===============================\n\nI wrestled with how to represent concepts like\
  \ \"attribute can be this or\nthat\".  I could do it either of these ways:\n\n1.\
  \  owner=matt&owner=lindsey\n2.  owner=matt,lindsey\n\nI decided to go with #1 because\
  \ it is obvious that there are two keys\nwith the same name.  It might be possible\
  \ that #2 means that I need to\nmatch an attribute that is exactly defined as \"\
  matt,lindsey\".\n\nMy parsing code would need to treat commas as special characters."
