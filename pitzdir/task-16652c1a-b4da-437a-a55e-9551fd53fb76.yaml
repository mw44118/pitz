description: "This will make a bag with all tasks attached to the first milestone::\n\
  \n    >>> m1 = p.milestones[0]\n    >>> p.tasks(milestone=m1)\n\nI can't do this\
  \ easily from the command line.  I wish I could something\nlike this::\n\n    $\
  \ pitz-everything type=milestone\n      ==============\n      subset of Pitz\n \
  \     ==============\n\n      (2 milestone entities)\n      ----------------------\n\
  \n         0: d734c3 Mythical 1.0 release: 100% complete (30 / 30 tasks)\n     \
  \    1: b956c9 2.0: 0% complete (0 / 1 tasks)\n\n\nAnd then feed in the UUID frag\
  \ for the milestone into pitz-everything\nlike this::\n\n    $ pitz-everything type=task\
  \ milestone=d734c3\n\nI think the simplest thing would be a function that takes\
  \ an input\nstring like d734c3 and then decides if that matches one and only one\n\
  entity in the project.\n\nIf so, I could replace the ugly string with with the entity."
