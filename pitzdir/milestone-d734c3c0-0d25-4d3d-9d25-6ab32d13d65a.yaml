description: "Originally, I had a wacky idea to make pitz a framework for building\n\
  issue trackers, rather than just an issue tracker.\n\nIn other words, pitz would\
  \ accomodate any bizarre workflow that anyone\ncould dream up.  For example, I didn't\
  \ want to assume that there would\nbe anything called milestones or tasks or components.\
  \  All of that\nwould be user-configurable.\n\nHere's the problem: code where **everything**\
  \ is configurable gets\nreally, really complex.\n\nditz has a neat command, todo::\n\
  \n    $ ditz todo # Lists all unfinished tasks\n    $ ditz todo feb09 # Just unfinished\
  \ tasks in the feb09 release.\n\nThe underlying code is clean because ditz forces\
  \ a one-to-many\nrelationship between releases and tasks and more importantly, the\
  \ names\nof releases have to be unique.\n\nIt is easy for ditz to look up the release\
  \ named \"feb09\" and then look\nup all the attached tasks.\n\nAs of right now in\
  \ pitz, that same query is easy from within python::\n\n    >>> feb09 = p(type=milestone,\
  \ title='feb09')\n    >>> print(p(type=task, milestone=feb09)\n\nThat turned out\
  \ to be the easy part.  I came across two hard parts:\n\n1.  I couldn't make any\
  \ assumptions about the relationship between tasks\n    and milestones, since I\
  \ was trying to be so agnostic.  The system\n    would allow, for example, somebody\
  \ to make the milestone attribute\n    point at a list of milestones or even have\
  \ it point to another task.\n\n2.  Presenting the data without making any assumptions\
  \ about its meaning\n    seemed impossible.  Ditz shows the status of individual\
  \ tasks.\n    Again, I didn't want to push my agenda on the user, so maybe tasks\n\
  \    won't even have a status.  So how do I build a usable interface?  I\n    just\
  \ gave and dumped out all the attribute-value pairs.  Not\n    gorgeous.\n\nSo my\
  \ new goal is to reduce the scope of the 1.0 release and make a lot\nof assumptions\
  \ and limits.  Instead of a framework that lets you create\nany arbitrary workflows,\
  \ a lot of stuff will be fixed.\n\nI'm going to shrink the scope and improve user\
  \ experience.\n\nThe consequence is that when I start working on 2.0, it is likely\
  \ I will\nhave to break stuff.  And I think that is OK.\n\nWith pitz, I don't want\
  \ to try to build in all the features first.  The\n2,0 release might not be just\
  \ a superset.  Instead it might be a\ndifferent app altogether.\n"
