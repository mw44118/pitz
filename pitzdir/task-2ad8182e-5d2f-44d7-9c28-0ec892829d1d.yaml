  \nmkdir pitz_buildout\ncd pitz_buildout\nwget\n\"http://svn.zope.org/*checkout*/zc.buildout/trunk/bootstrap/bootstrap.py\"\
  \ncat <<EOF > buildout.cfg\n[buildout]\nnewest = false\nparts = eggs\nextensions\

  \n[eggs]\nrecipe = zc.recipe.egg\neggs =\n   pitz\n   EOF\n\n   python bootstrap.py\n\
  \   ./bin/buildout\n\n   This will install pitz in develop mode and it's dependencies\
  \ in\n   ./eggs.\n\n   Btw there is no errors. scripts are just not installed.\n\
  \   With entry_points, scripts are found in the ./bin directory. You can\n   try\
  \ to add IPython in the eggs option, re-run ./bin/buildout and\n   you'll see ipy*\
  \ in ./bin\n\n   As an exemple here is a setup.py with console_scripts:\n   http://www.gawel.org/docs/rstctl/file/077270cc4a97/setup.py\n\
