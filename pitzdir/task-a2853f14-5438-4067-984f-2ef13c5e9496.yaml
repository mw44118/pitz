description: 'Since projects are bag subclasses, not entities, the project code isn''t

  changed.


  The effect of all this is that now I save the yaml and the pickle out

  every single time.


  The simplest solution is to always save the pickle, but make sure to do

  it AFTER saving any of the yaml files.
