description: 'The pitz-setup script is what somebody should run to start using pitz.


  First it should list all the possible pitz project types (AgileProject,

  SimpleProject, etc) and ask which to use.  For each project type, the

  script should list the module docstring.


  Then the script should make a pitzfiles directory and copy the module

  for that project into that pitzfiles dir.


  The script should do this so that people can alter their pitz project

  without needing to alter the core pitz code.
