description: "This IRC session explains the problem::\n\n    18:42 < mw44118> So,\
  \ can somebody explain what is so bad about subclassing list?\n    18:42 -!- azlev\
  \ [n=ze@200.234.206.72] has quit [\"Leaving\"]\n    18:43 < kn100> _bauer: ahh,\
  \ i tend to use spe\n    18:43 < dash> mw44118: you don't really want all of list's\
  \ behaviour\n    18:43 < KirkMcDonald> mw44118: The methods of the list type do\
  \ not perform virtual calls on its other methods.\n    18:43 < dash> mw44118: and\
  \ since list's existing methods won't call your code, you have to override everything\
  \ anyway\n    18:43 < kn100> i just keep a terminal open with python sitting in\
  \ my dock for trying shit out\n    18:43 < mw44118> KirkMcDonald: is that also true\
  \ when subclassing dict?\n    18:43 < dash> yes\n    18:43 < KirkMcDonald> mw44118:\
  \ Yes.\n    18:44 < mw44118> KirkMcDonald: I came across that issue with dict. \
  \ I defined my own __setitem__, then discovered self.update() ignored my own.\n\
  \    18:44 -!- bgeddy [n=bgeddy@82-42-231-37.cable.ubr19.live.blueyonder.co.uk]\
  \ has quit [Remote closed the connection]\n    18:44 < KirkMcDonald> Indeed.\n \
  \   18:44 < mw44118> KirkMcDonald: so, should I use a composition approach, and\
  \ have a self._data object of type list or dict?\n    18:44 -!- lurkymclurkleton\
  \ [n=ajsmith@wsip-174-79-184-194.dc.dc.cox.net] has quit [Read error: 113 (No route\
  \ to host)]\n    18:44 < dash> i'd recommend it\n    18:45 < superdmp> OK, many\
  \ thanks arkanes bob2 and others, I will continue reading and try a few things out\n\
  \    18:45 < KirkMcDonald> mw44118: Yes, this is what I would recommend.\n    18:45\
  \ < mw44118> KirkMcDonald: thanks for the help.\n\nIn other words, a subclass of\
  \ list won't use my __getitem__ on its own\ninternal calls to stuff."
