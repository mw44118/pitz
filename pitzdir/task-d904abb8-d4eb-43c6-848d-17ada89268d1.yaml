description: "It would be nice to run a command like pitz-recent-updates and see stuff\n\
  like:\n\n    \n    *   Matt created task 123abc\n    *   Matt edited title on task\
  \ 456def and changed it to \"blah\"\n    *   Matt edited description on task 789ghi\
  \ and changed it to \n        \"blah blah blah...\"\n    *   Matt changed status\
  \ on task 321cba to finished, and wrote \n        comment \"This was easy!\"\n\n\
  And so forth.  \n\nEach time I do something, pitz would record a short description\
  \ of the\naction (generated automatically) and store it in the project.\n\nThe goal\
  \ here is to do all this automatically.\n"
