description: 'Right now, Entity subclasses can define a class attribute named

  pointers that is a dictionary.


  Pitz uses this dictionary to figure out what attributes should get

  replaced by lookups in the project.


  I want to explore if I can just use a simpler approach.  When I run

  replace_objects_with_pointers, I''ll go through every attribute in the

  enttity, and if the attribute itself has a ''uuid'' attribute, then I''ll

  use that.


  Likewise, when I load a yaml file, when the value is a UUID instance,

  I''ll do a lookup on the project and replace that.
