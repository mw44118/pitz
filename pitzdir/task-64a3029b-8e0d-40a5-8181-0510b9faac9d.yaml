description: "Right now, in the Task class, I have this code::\n\n    allowed_values\
  \ = dict(\n            status=['unstarted', 'started', 'abandoned', 'finished'],\n\
  \                )\n\nPitz uses this to make sure that the status has one of those\
  \ values.  It\nmight be nicer to just make an assertion that the status field must\
  \ be\nan instance of a Status entity.  And the each project could define\nwhatever\
  \ status it wanted to.\n"
